# Defining a workflow job environment
#
# Now, let’s add initial setup for our job.
# It’s a process that will execute commands that we’ll define later. I
# n this guide, we’ll use the latest stable Ubuntu LTS version provided by GitHub Actions:

jobs:
  build-n-publish:
    name: Build and publish Python 🐍 distributions 📦 to PyPI and TestPyPI
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

# Checking out the project and building distributions
#
# Then, add the following under the build-n-publish section:

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - name: Set up Python 3.10
      uses: actions/setup-python@v3
      with:
        python-version: "3.10"

    - name: Install pypa/build
      run: >-
        python -m
        pip install
        build
        --user
    - name: Build a binary wheel and a source tarball
      run: >-
        python -m
        build
        --sdist
        --wheel
        --outdir dist/
        .

# Publishing the distribution to PyPI and TestPyPI
#
# Finally, add the following steps at the end:

    - name: Publish distribution 📦 to Test PyPI
      uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
      with:
        password: ${{ secrets.TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN }}
        repository_url: https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
    - name: Publish distribution 📦 to PyPI
      if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags')
      uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
