```{admonition} Note
:class: note
for us:
These is a list of ideas for when you are done with experiments/acquisition I would like to add.
- [x] reorganize your folders (optional but recommended)
- [x] copy your data to the server
- [x] clossing software
- [x] clossing hardware
- [x] cleanning the perfusion system 
- [ ] other?

```


# Closing the setup

## Organize and save your data

```{admonition} Important!
:class: danger
Always back up your data on the server to reduce risk of data lost.

```
After finishing an experiments/operation with the setup, make sure you transfer your data on the server. **The PC dedicated to the experiments does not currently have a backup**, so make sure that your data is saved on the Institute cloud.

- [x] Reorganize your folders based on the expeiments/annotations, etc (otional but highly recommended).

- [x] Save copy of your data on the server. Raw optical map data and experiments are normally stored on the GroupOdening servr under the folder:
 `/Volumes/GroupOdening/OM_data_Bern/raw_data/2024`.


## Clossing software

Checklist of software to close:

### Powerlab
Simply save and close the current file. Then, just close the application as you normally will do with any other program.
### Andor Solis
If you have modified the acquisiton setting, the Andor Solis always ask always ask to overwrite the settings to the default one. Please choose not to overwrite.
### Napari-omaas 
Just close the application as you normally will do with any other program.
### Picoscope

Just close the application as you normally will do with any other program.

## Shutdown hardware

Make sure you swutdown the following instruments:

- [x] Switch off the Camera
- [x] Switch off the Powerlab
- [x] Switch off the Pacer
- [x] Switch off the experiment Computer

## Clean the perfusion system

The perfusion system is composed of two perfusion circuits: 
 - the **aortic block**
 - the **recirculation bath**

 Use destilled and deionized water (18 M ohms) to perfuse exaustively the system. At least 2 L of water for each of the circuits. Finally, make sure to: :
  - [x] shutdown the water bath 
  - [x] shutdown the pumps
  - [x] shutdown the oxigen supplier
  - [x] open all valves and clamsp form the perfusion system.
  - [x] release the tubing clamps from the 2 pumps
